    "## Description of Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "As the training & testing datasets from our first & second assignments has become defunct recently ([*The Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus* by Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, György Szarvas, & Noah A. Smith (October 6th, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02573) [1]), in this assignment, *A4: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs)*, we will be using a new dataset, the \"[*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual)\" [2] - where we will be exploring & comparing the performance of two, specific ***Large Language Models*** (**LLMs**):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [*Meta*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)'s [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) (*Large Language Model Meta AI 2*) [3], [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "&\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (As of November 27th, 2023, ***```ChatGPT```*** is currently running the November 6th, 2023 Update model version of *GPT-3.5 Turbo* [***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [5]-[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the previous two assignment, this assignment focuses on using specific NLP models - specifically, [*Meta*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)'s [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [3], [4] and [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ***Large Language Models*** (**LLMs**) [5], [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "As a different approach in comparison to our previous three (3) assignments, in this current assignment, *A4*, instead of implementing a full text-classification model for sentiment-prediction, we will instead be exploring the techniques of [*prompt engineering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438) [8] in creating a text-classifier - in comparison to previous assignment, *A3*, where we had used the monolingual *Pretrained Language Models* (***PLMs***) of [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) [9] and [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation\n",
    "In *A4*, we will be using a new dataset, [*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2], which is a multilingual dataset with Tweets labeled with a ```sentiment``` value, where the classification labels are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```0``` indicating *```negative```*,\n",
    "\n",
    "```1``` indicating *```neutral```*,\n",
    "\n",
    "...and a ```2``` indicating *```positive```*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2] dataset contains sentiment-labeled Tweets in Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using several thousands of data-entries, for both a training and a testing dataset to train and test our text-classification model like we've explored in our previous assignments, of assignments *A1* through *A3* - in this assignment, *A4*, we will *instead* be utilizing a __much smaller subset of data__ from our [***new dataset***](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2] & only utilizing a testing dataset based on a sampling of Tweet-entries across the different languages, in lieu of using both a testing and training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will be creating a multilingual, Tweet-entry-based testing dataset, of a recommended amount of ~50 instances (the actual number used in my implementation will be specified below in my ***Text Classification Through Prompt Engineering*** section) of the testing dataset for each language as aforementioned, and sentimentality-wise, we will only look at the Tweet-entries with either the *```positive```* or *```negative```* sentiment labels, and will be ignoring Tweet-entries with the *```neutral```* sentiment label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although no training will be required, we will still need to carefully prepare a balanced test set across both classes, and throughout our various languages sampled from the [***new dataset***](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Researcher Golam Md. Muktadir of the University of California, Santa Cruz, Computer Science and Engineering (muktadir@ucsc.edu) describes in good detail, the past-to-present history of *prompt engineering* in their relatively recent September 30th, 2023 paper, \"[*A Brief History of Prompt: Leveraging Language Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438)\" [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern day *prompt engineering* can be described by the following description...\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...***researchers and practitioners [who] have explored various techniques to harness the full potential of language models, leveraging the power of prompts to guide, control, and tailor the output of these sophisticated AI systems.***...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "...where this *__very description__* of *prompt engineering* originates from a generated text borne of *prompt engineering* itself, as given by Researcher Muktadir in their paper's introduction, from these two prompts [8]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**Prompt #1**: *You are a scholar in machine learning and language models. I am writing a paper on the history of prompt engineering and generation. Can you give me a timeline for prompt engineering evolution? (We used this timeline to create prompts for each section later)*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "&\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**Prompt #2**: *Write the introduction of this paper. Emphasize that this paper focuses on how language prompts and queries have been used so far.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While the techniques of *prompt engineering*, seemingly only recently popularized, or rather, been made the spotlight mainstream subject of discussion of recent, in regard to the wide field of *Natural Language Processing* (***NLP***) - this popularization, of course, significantly due to the rise of [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) [6], [7] - however, nonetheless are a set of techniques a history long prior to this very novel advent of widely accessible platforms providing services based on *Natural Language Processing* (***NLP***) study & more specifically, through *Large Language Models* (***LLMs***) [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "As section-titled in their paper, Researcher Muktadir describes an early era of *prompt engineering* in \"*Prehistoric Prompting: Pre NN-Era*\", which describes among the most preliminary studies into what we know as *prompt engineering* today - as far back as the 1960s through the 1970s with \"*Early Natural Language Interfaces*\", the 1990s through the 2010s with \"*Advances in Natural Language Processing*\", e.g. *Neural Networks* (***NNs***) and *Machine Learning* (***ML***), to modern-day, featuring the rise of **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***) of those, we will exploring of two such ***MLLMs*** [8].\n",

    "### Multilingual Large Language Models (Multilingual LLMs, or 'MLLMs')\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can/will be accessing our two **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***), [*Meta*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)'s [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [3], [4] and [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***) [5], [6], would be through the graphical interface chat platform provided through [*HuggingFace* Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat) [11].\n",

    "The first ***MLLM*** we will be exploring will be the ***__open-source__***, [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) (*Large Language Model Meta AI 2*) [4] ***MLLM***, which was first co-released by [*Meta* and *Microsoft*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-2/), back on June 17th, 2023 [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "This ***MLLM*** was first released & described as ***```LLaMA (Version 1)```*** in the paper, [\"*LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models*\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) [13] - which was first published earlier this year in February 27th, 2023, by the [*Meta AI*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) team [3] - authored by Researchers Hugo Touvron, and thirteen (13) other authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first version of ***```LLaMA```*** was described as \"*a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters*\", these models having been trained on \"*trillions of tokens*\", and importantly, claiming that *it is* and *was possible* to \"*train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets* **__exclusively__**\" - claiming, that the-then ***```LLaMA-13B```*** model outperformed the ***```GPT-3 (175B)```*** model on \"*most benchmarks*\" [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "The second iteration, ***```LLaMA 2```*** has been released as part of various ***fine-tuned LLMs***, e.g. *```LLaMA 2-Chat```*, *```Code LLaMA 2```*, etc. - as to represent the latest efforts by [*Meta* and *Microsoft*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-2/) to provide their updated advancements of their open-source ***LLM*** - where, in their [**paper**](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/), they claim that the latest ***```LLaMA 2```*** ***LLM(s)*** are capable and *very* comparable in performance to those of other closed-source ***LLMs***, either in regard to a closed-source based set of techniques used to create the ***LLM(s)*** and/or a closed-source service that is provided as *SaaS* (***Software as a Service***), e.g. [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s\n",

    "### OpenAI's Proprietary **ChatGPT** (*Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer*) Multilingual Large Language Model (MLLM) [5]-[7]\n",
    "The most famous ***MLLM*** model as of recent mainstream attention, is the proprietary model [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (based on *Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 Turbo*, currently on the November 6th, 2023 update-iteration, [***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) is based off advancements made by [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/) on the closed-source 'release' of [***```GPT-3```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), and of course, follows the progress made from the second predecessor, [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) [6], [7], [5], [15], [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling from *A3*:\n",
    "In ***```GPT-2```***'s [technical paper](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), *OpenAI* researchers Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever describes the ***```GPT-2```*** model - a ***__unidirectional__*** model trained on a dataset of *8 million web pages* with **1.5 billion parameters** ([*OpenAI*](https://openai.com/research/better-language-models), [Radford et al.](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we were to make a quick GPT lineage comparison between ***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```*** vs. ***```GPT-2```***, of course, the former, ***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***, has up to ***175 billion parameters*** & the latter, at least the largest-parameter version of ***```GPT-2```***, has still only ***1.5 billion parameters*** - representing an extremely significant increase in parameter-power in ***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```*** over its long predecessor ***```GPT-2```*** model.\n",

    "1. Prepare a balanced test set of a specific, constant chosen-size of test Tweet-instances for each of the eight different languages from our new dataset, [*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2].

    "\n",
    "That [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [4] competes with [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ([***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [6], [7] at this kind of *multilingual* level & performance, especially, was really awesome to see!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results and Analysis: Le Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"*How do the two LLMs perform? Which one is better? Any possible explanation?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    As discussed in the introductory sections, one of the most prominent differences in these *Large Language Models* (***LLMs***) is that [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [4] is an *open-source* model, while [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ([***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [6], [7] is a *closed-source* model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Surely, performance by pursuit of profit, is not the only factor in the *slight* edge that [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ([***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [6], [7] has shown over its 100% free, open-source [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [4] model - however, with more funding & profit, may have led to a much greater ability for *Research & Development* of *GPT* models over time, where speaking of, *OpenAI* has been long developing its *GPT lineage*. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"*Comparing the results across the six different languages, what do you observe? Any possible explanation?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    I think two most interesting things noted were firstly, the Arabic prowess of [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [4] over [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ([***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [6], [7], and secondly - rightfully so, the French language being the most difficult for both our ***MLLMs*** to predict sentiment, a hope that perhaps some things still remain just a little bit within the creativity of humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "    As briefly mentioned, I think the most obvious answer for [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [4] having a edge over [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ([***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [6], [7] in the Arabic language may have been greater exposure to Arabic texts & training data. Or it could also have been a statistical fluke, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"*What challenges did you face?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using a GUI for genuine *Natural Language Processing* (***NLP***) projects & analysis, was very surprisingly one of the biggest challenges. A limitation & an almost felt-delay of the simulated human-typing, letter-crawling as you wait for one of your 50+ prompts to finish being outputted by either GUI of *```ChatGPT```* or *```LLaMA 2```* was a bit of a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, the biggest challenge, I think, was the unfortunate, massive delay caused due to *```HuggingChat```* being down - but *```HuggingFace```* is still & has been a wonderful, great (and very vital) resource in the realm of ***NLP***, CS, & in general, a super cool resource - so I think it was a fluke, but one that was a bit significant & caused a lot of stress, as I tried to scramble a way to get our last assignment done - alas, we survive. Hopefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Engineering Challenges & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with great, simple, & pinpoint prompt engineering - I still saw that outputs still can & did vary wildly for no reason. However, this was only really present when using the [*```LLaMA-2-7b-chat```*](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat) - if I had access to set the ***temperature*** or other settings through the API, I think such output-variational issues *could* have been mitigated slightly - yet, it was not a significant challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation in the literal sense, however, was that even with fairly simple text-classification or parsing-related prompts, a ratelimit or limit to the *'generatable output-in-one-go'* were present in both LLM platforms, where using an automated API does seem, if we instead used, *A4* may not have been as much of a struggle - however, the struggle was worth it, I think. I can say I know a little about how *ChatGPT* works now, heheh."
