    "#### Description of Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Introduction\n",
    "As the training & testing datasets from our first & second assignments has become defunct recently ([*The Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus* by Phillip Keung, Yichao Lu, Gy√∂rgy Szarvas, & Noah A. Smith (October 6th, 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02573) [1]), in this assignment, *A4: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs)*, we will be using a new dataset, the \"[*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual)\" [2] - where we will be exploring & comparing the performance of two, specific ***Large Language Models*** (**LLMs**):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [*Meta*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)'s [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) (*Large Language Model Meta AI 2*) [3], [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "&\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (As of November 27th, 2023, ***```ChatGPT```*** is currently running the November 6th, 2023 Update model version of *GPT-3.5 Turbo* [***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) [5]-[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the previous two assignment, this assignment focuses on using specific NLP models - specifically, [*Meta*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)'s [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [3], [4] and [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ***Large Language Models*** (**LLMs**) [5], [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "As a different approach in comparison to our previous three (3) assignments, in this current assignment, *A4*, instead of implementing a full text-classification model for sentiment-prediction, we will instead be exploring the techniques of [*prompt engineering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438) [8] in creating a text-classifier - in comparison to previous assignment, *A3*, where we had used the monolingual *Pretrained Language Models* (***PLMs***) of [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) [9] and [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Preparation\n",
    "In *A4*, we will be using a new dataset, [*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2], which is a multilingual dataset with Tweets labeled with a ```sentiment``` value, where the classification labels are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```0``` indicating *```negative```*,\n",
    "\n",
    "```1``` indicating *```neutral```*,\n",
    "\n",
    "...and a ```2``` indicating *```positive```*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [*Unified Multilingual Sentiment Analysis Benchmark*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2] dataset contains sentiment-labeled Tweets in Arabic, English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using several thousands of data-entries, for both a training and a testing dataset to train and test our text-classification model like we've explored in our previous assignments, of assignments *A1* through *A3* - in this assignment, *A4*, we will *instead* be utilizing a __much smaller subset of data__ from our [***new dataset***](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2] & only utilizing a testing dataset based on a sampling of Tweet-entries across the different languages, in lieu of using both a testing and training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will be creating a multilingual, Tweet-entry-based testing dataset, of around ~50 instances of the testing dataset for each language as aforementioned, and sentimentality-wise, we will only look at the Tweet-entries with either the *```positive```* or *```negative```* sentiment labels, and will be ignoring Tweet-entries with the *```neutral```* sentiment label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although no training will be required, we will still need to carefully prepare a balanced test set across both classes, and throughout our various languages sampled from the [***new dataset***](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cardiffnlp/tweet_sentiment_multilingual) [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Researcher Golam Md. Muktadir of the University of California, Santa Cruz, Computer Science and Engineering (muktadir@ucsc.edu) describes in good detail, the past-to-present history of *prompt engineering* in their relatively recent September 30th, 2023 paper, \"[*A Brief History of Prompt: Leveraging Language Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04438)\" [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern day *prompt engineering* can be described by the following description...\n",
    "\n",
    "\"...***researchers and practitioners [who] have explored various techniques to harness the full potential of language models, leveraging the power of prompts to guide, control, and tailor the output of these sophisticated AI systems.***...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "...where this *__very description__* of *prompt engineering* originates from a generated text borne of *prompt engineering* itself, as given by Researcher Muktadir in their paper's introduction, from these two prompts [8]:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**Prompt #1**: *You are a scholar in machine learning and language models. I am writing a paper on the history of prompt engineering and generation. Can you give me a timeline for prompt engineering evolution? (We used this timeline to create prompts for each section later)*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "&\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**Prompt #2**: *Write the introduction of this paper. Emphasize that this paper focuses on how language prompts and queries have been used so far.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While the techniques of *prompt engineering*, seemingly only recently popularized, or rather, been made the spotlight mainstream subject of discussion of recent, in regard to the wide field of *Natural Language Processing* (***NLP***) - this popularization, of course, significantly due to the rise of [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) [6], [7] - however, nonetheless are a set of techniques a history long prior to this very novel advent of widely accessible platforms providing services based on *Natural Language Processing* (***NLP***) study & more specifically, through *Large Language Models* (***LLMs***) [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "As section-titled in their paper, Researcher Muktadir describes an early era of *prompt engineering* in \"*Prehistoric Prompting: Pre NN-Era*\", which describes among the most preliminary studies into what we know as *prompt engineering* today - as far back as the 1960s through the 1970s with \"*Early Natural Language Interfaces*\", the 1990s through the 2010s with \"*Advances in Natural Language Processing*\", e.g. *Neural Networks* (***NNs***) and *Machine Learning* (***ML***), to modern-day, featuring the rise of **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***) of those, we will exploring of two such ***MLLMs*** [8].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multilingual Large Language Models (Multilingual LLMs, or 'MLLMs')\n",
    "\n",
    "One way we can/will be accessing our two **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***), [*Meta*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)'s [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) [3], [4] and [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***) [5], [6], would be through the graphical interface chat platform provided through [*HuggingFace* Chat](https://huggingface.co/chat) [11] (or through *HuggingFace*'s various NLP libraries, e.g. as used from our *A3* assignment, the [```transformers```](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)) library [12]).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, *A4*, we will be focusing on __answering the following questions__ through our exploration of the two aforementioned ***MLLMs*** - and the results and analysis from our exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"*How do the two LLMs perform? Which one is better? Any possible explanation?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"*Comparing the results across the six different languages, what do you observe? Any possible explanation?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"*What challenges did you face?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Meta's Open-Source **LLaMA 2** (*Large Language Model Meta AI 2*) Multilingual Large Language Model (MLLM) [3], [4]\n",
    "The first ***MLLM*** we will be exploring will be the ***__open-source__***, [***```LLaMA 2```***](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) (*Large Language Model Meta AI 2*) [4] ***MLLM***, which was first co-released by [*Meta* and *Microsoft*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-2/), back on June 17th, 2023 [14].\n",
    "\n",
    "This ***MLLM*** was first released & described as ***```LLaMA (Version 1)```*** in the paper, [\"*LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models*\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) [13] - which was first published earlier this year in February 27th, 2023, by the [*Meta AI*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) team [3] - authored by Researchers Hugo Touvron, and thirteen (13) other authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first version of ***```LLaMA```*** was described as \"*a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters*\", these models having been trained on \"*trillions of tokens*\", and importantly, claiming that *it is* and *was possible* to \"*train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets* **__exclusively__**\" - claiming, that the-then ***```LLaMA-13B```*** model outperformed the ***```GPT-3 (175B)```*** model on \"*most benchmarks*\" [13].\n",
    "\n",
    "The second iteration, ***```LLaMA 2```*** has been released as part of various ***fine-tuned LLMs***, e.g. *```LLaMA 2-Chat```*, *```Code LLaMA 2```*, etc. - as to represent the latest efforts by [*Meta* and *Microsoft*](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-2/) to provide their updated advancements of their open-source ***LLM*** - where, in their [**paper**](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/), they claim that the latest ***```LLaMA 2```*** ***LLM(s)*** are capable and *very* comparable in performance to those of other closed-source ***LLMs***, either in regard to a closed-source based set of techniques used to create the ***LLM(s)*** and/or a closed-source service that is provided as *SaaS* (***Software as a Service***), e.g. [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/)'s\n",
    " [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) [14], [4], [5], [6]. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### OpenAI's Proprietary **ChatGPT** (*Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer*) Multilingual Large Language Model (MLLM) [5]-[7]\n",
    "The most famous ***MLLM*** model as of recent mainstream attention, is the proprietary model [***```ChatGPT```***](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) (based on *Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 Turbo*, currently on the November 6th, 2023 update-iteration, [***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)) is based off advancements made by [*OpenAI*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/) on the closed-source 'release' of [***```GPT-3```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165), and of course, follows the progress made from the second predecessor, [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) [6], [7], [5], [15], [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "Recalling from *A3*:\n",
    "In ***```GPT-2```***'s [technical paper](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), *OpenAI* researchers Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever describes the ***```GPT-2```*** model - a ***__unidirectional__*** model trained on a dataset of *8 million web pages* with **1.5 billion parameters** ([*OpenAI*](https://openai.com/research/better-language-models), [Radford et al.](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) [10].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we were to make a quick GPT lineage comparison between ***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```*** vs. ***```GPT-2```***, of course, the former, ***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***, has up to ***175 billion parameters*** & the latter, at least the largest-parameter version of ***```GPT-2```***, has still only ***1.5 billion parameters*** - representing an extremely significant increase in parameter-power in ***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```*** over its long predecessor ***```GPT-2```*** model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comparison of **LLaMA-2** vs. **ChatGPT** **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***) Architectures & Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing [**```LLaMA 2```**](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) vs. [**```ChatGPT```**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) ([***```gpt-3.5-turbo-1106```***](https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday)), the first difference we can note is that, since [**```LLaMA 1```**](https://ai.meta.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) was released & now with [**```LLaMA 2```**](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/), [**```LLaMA```**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) has remained available as a series of ***open-source*** **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLM***), as released & created by *Meta's AI Team* (& [*Microsoft* for version 2](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-2/)) - where anyone is able to request & receive access to freely download the model & its fine-tuned derivatives as per the nature open-source vs. the proprietary nature of [**```ChatGPT```**](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), which is only offered indirectly, as a **Software-as-a-Service** (***SaaS***) through the free version of *OpenAI*'s main *```ChatGPT```* *web-platform* ([chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/)) or as a paid service through *OpenAI*'s [*API platform*](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/) [4], [6], [7], [3], [13], [14], [6], [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "From September 1st, 2023, Enterprise AI Strategist Sunil Ramlochan of the *Prompt Engineering Institute* described in the summary of their article, [*How Does Llama-2 Compare to GPT-4/3.5 and Other AI Language Models*](https://promptengineering.org/how-does-llama-2-compare-to-gpt-and-other-ai-language-models/) that **```LLaMA 2```** \"*competes on accuracy despite lower complexity [vs. the complexity of GPT-3.5]*\" - where such strong accuracy could be through *Meta*'s various improvements from **LLaMA 1** to **LLaMA 2**, e.g. *Ghost Attention*, which may improve 'dialogue context tracking' [16].\n",
    "\n",
    "As cited in [16], Researcher Waleed Kadous of *anyscale* performed an analysis of our two **Multilingual Large Language Models** (***MLLMs***), in their supportively titled (of the claims made in [16]) article, \"[*Llama 2 is about as factually accurate as GPT-4 for summaries and is 30X cheaper*](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/llama-2-is-about-as-factually-accurate-as-gpt-4-for-summaries-and-is-30x-cheaper?ref=promptengineering.org)\" [17]:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Text Classification Model\n",
    "To build our text-classification model, we will __follow these steps__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implementing & setting up our two (2) **Pretrained Language Models** (***PLMs***), [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) and [***```GPT-2```***](C:\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the specific tokenizer used for each respective ***PLM*** to prepare the training & testing text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training of the text-classification model using the specifically-tokenized training dataset for each ***PLM***, based on \"sentiment_train.json.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation of our text-classification model using the specifically-tokenized testing dataset for each ***PLM***, based on \"sentiment_test.json.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Results & Analysis\n",
    "A detailed analysis of the model's performance by comparing the results from the output of our two algorithms, where we will __include the following__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *F1-score* or other relevant metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Any challenges or limitations of the text-classification model/task.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Additionally***, we will also try to provide a comparative analysis based on the results from our two previous assignments, our first assignment, *A1: Sentiment Analysis Text Classification* & from our second assignment, *A2: ```Word2Vec``` and ```GloVe``` Embeddings*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we recall from our previous two assignments, that we first implemented text-classification models based on two suitable algorithms (*A1*), and in our second, implemented the usage of ```Word2Vec``` & ```GloVe``` pretrained embeddings to assist in our text-classification tasks (*A1*)."

    "#### Pretrained Language Model (PLM) Comparative Analysis & Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results above, we see that both [*Google AI*](https://blog.research.google/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html)'s [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) & [*OpenAI*](https://openai.com/research/better-language-models)'s [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) ***PLMs*** faired very well in accuracy, of ~91.6% & 87.4% respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Between these two ***PLMs***, [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) & [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), we can see that from our performance results that there is/was a slight, low *difference of accuracy*, where [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) has a ***higher*** **accuracy** of *___~4.2%___* in *comparison to [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, by looking at the respective Confusion Matrices for our two ***PLMs***, we can see that [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), of course, was able to classify sentiment more accurately than [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf), but we also can observe that [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) seems to be *a little bit* more efficient in detecting *negative* sentimentality vs. [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) lean towards *positive* sentimentality - however, [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)'s decreased accuracy in detecting *negative* sentiment seems to be more significant in magnitude compared to the aforementioned, *negative* over *positive* sentimentality bias, of [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, a possible scenario where this supposed sentimentality bias in our text-classification task may present itself as to yield a different result, at least for accuracy & the F1 score, may lie in how the positive & negative sentiment composition during the processing of our training & testing dataset, particularly, at the time of randomized splitting.\n",
    "Specifically, if we had somehow chosen a random seed in our splitting code, that supposedly had much more positive or negative sentimentality in the composition of the reviews, we could have seen variations from our initial performance & results as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ergo, between [*Google AI*](https://blog.research.google/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html)'s [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) & [*OpenAI*](https://openai.com/research/better-language-models)'s [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) ***PLMs***, [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) seems to be a clearly more suitable model, at least for the text-classification task & model with our assignment's training & dataset, \"[*Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02573).\"\n",

    "This is interesting, as while it appears that using ***PLMs*** over ***pretrained embeddings*** yielded much significant improvements in both accuracy & performance, the results from using only the Logistic Regression Algorithm with no classifiers had yielded a *92.7% accuracy*, which still stands as one of the most accurate results from our three (3) assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this observation & other possible variations that can be observed, in performance & results, may be attributed to both the nature of text-tokenization, usage of classifiers, & particularly, that in the implementation of the first text-classification model of our *A1* assignment, I had trained the text-classification model cases with the ***full, eighty-thousand (80,000) rows of training data***, while in our current *A3* implementation, the training data for both the [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) & [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) ***PLMs*** were truncated randomly (with a shared random seed of ```69```) to a quarter-percent (25%) of the original number of rows, or twenty-thousand (20,000) rows of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text-Classification Challenges & Limitations\n",
    "The initial & biggest challenge to implement these **pretrained language models** (***PLMs***) was the very significantly resource & time-intensive requirements for the computation, tokenization, & training of the two (2) ***PLMs*** used.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the current version of code & implementation, in average, it appeared that [***```BERT```***](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) took around *two-to-eight (2-to-8) minutes*, while [***```GPT-2```***](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) took longer, around *five-to-fifteen (5-to-15) minutes* long. Both, on average, usually took around *fifteen-to-thirty (15-to-30) minutes* to fully complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the earlier stages of coding & implementation, particularly before truncating the training & testing datasets to the currently-set percentage of twenty-five percent (25%) of the original amount of rows/lines of text, the average varied wildly, with completion durations taking *hours, upon hours* to complete or were stopped prior to completion due to time constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, even post-truncation adjustments, the pretraining of the two ***PLMs***, in terms of computational power & resources, were very intensive, which had caused ***multiple***, **full computer crashes**, leading to a lot of processing delays & mental energy to continue implementing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion for Future Performance & Efficacy Improvements\n",
    "With the issue of computational resources & the prevention of computer crashes, would be, of course, to finally sign-up for the student discounted *Google Cloud* subscription for using high-resource, cloud computing in *Google Colaboratory*, where NLP compatible, GPU-acceleration is available to expedite ***PLM***, model training, or otherwise for running intensive NLP code & tasks.\n",
    "As such, this specific idea for future performance & efficacy improvement will be implemented immediately following this current assignment, *A3*, where I will go ahead & attempt to set-up *Google Colaboratory* for use to hopefully, avoid the aforementioned resource & crash pitfalls for *A4* and our *Group Project*, heh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I should attempt to start early & try to implement for assignments in smaller code-blocks/pieces."
