    "\n",
    "##### Data Preparation\n",
    "A dataset containing product customer reviews, which is named the \"Multilingual Amazon Reviews Corpus\", in a json-container format, with several columns. The assignment will focus on a smaller subset of the original dataset, where we will focus on __two (2) columns__:\n",
    "* \"review_title\" - self-explanatory\n",
    "* \"stars\" - an integer, either 1 or 5, where the former indicates \"negative\" and 5 indicates \"positive.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be a training set & a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will load the dataset using Python & use respective libraries to implement our text-classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, we will preprocess the data if needed, e.g. case-formating.\n",
    "##### Feature Engineering\n",
    "We will choose a set of classifiers to focus on in our text-classification model, e.g. *n*-grams, num words, cue words, repeated punctuation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Text Classification Model\n",
    "To build our text-classification model, we will __follow these steps__:\n",
    "* Any *two* chosen suitable algorithms for text classification.\n",
    "* Vectorization of the text data (conversion of text for numerical features).\n",
    "* Training of the text-classification model using the training dataset, \"sentiment_train.json.\"\n",
    "* Evaluation of our text-classification model using the testing dataset, \"sentiment_test.json.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Results & Analysis\n",
    "A detailed analysis of the model's performance by comparing the results from the output of our two algorithms, where we will __include the following__:\n",
    "* *F1-score* or other relevant metrics.\n",
    "* Confusion matrix.\n",
    "* Any challenges or limitations of the text-classification model/task.\n",
    "* Suggestions for improvement in the performance of the text-classification model."
